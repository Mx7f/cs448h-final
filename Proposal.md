A Language for Precision In FPGA
Michael Mara

* What is the goal of the project? What problem are you trying to solve?
* What do you hope to show when you are done? What are your deliverables?
* Why is it interesting, challenging, or important about the project?
* What previous work has been performed in this area?
  What resources do you plan on drawing upon?

The most relevant papers in this area are:

[Rigorous Floating-Point Mixed-Precision Tuning](http://soarlab.org/publications/popl2017-cbbsgr.pdf)

[Stochastic Optimization of Floating-Point Programs with Tunable Precision](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eschkufz/docs/pldi_14.pdf)

[Grater: an approximation workflow for exploiting data-level parallelism in FPGA acceleration](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alotfi/grater-date16.pdf)


A proposed project plan, including a timeline for the rest of the quarter.

* What are the major tasks and results you intend to pursue?
* How will you break them down?
* How are you planning to divide responsibility within your team?
