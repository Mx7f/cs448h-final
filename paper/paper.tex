\small
Agile hardware design is good.
Easy to write.
May be slow.
Large amount of shared effort so compilers generate efficient code.
No similar shared effort in hardware (though one of the things agile hardware seeks to remedy).

Recent advances in stochastic super optimization (STOKE) seek to replace and/or augment traditional optimization techniques for compilers

Stochastic Superoptimization of hardware
